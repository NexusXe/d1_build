# Build an Image for the Sipeed Lichee RV

An attempt to automate the build of an image, mostly to be able to learn how to do this.

Author: Tim Molteno (tim@molteno.net)

## How to use

This is intended to be used on a debian system with docker, and docker-compose installed.

    docker-compose build
    docker-compose up

The build stage does a lot of the work (compiling kernels e.t.c and takes quite a bit of time). Once this is done it will be cached by Docker, so should run faster. The execution stage (docker-compose up) runs a script that does more of the image building using a series of scripts (build.sh, create_image.sh).

This should produce a disk image in the directory ~/port/ of the user that ran the script.

There is a Makefile that automates this, and you can just type

    make

And the image will be built.

### Clean Build

Just issue,

    docker-compose build --no-cache

And everything will be rebulid (new kernel download e.t.c.). This is very slow (on my laptop)

## WORK-IN-PROGRESS

Caution. This is a work in progress and is not fully working yet. Help is appreciated.

You can try this:
- take smaeul's kernel
- add memory config to the dts
- build with hardcoded cmdline
- copy the modules to your SD card
- build oreboot with that kernel and dtb
- run via xfel

Daniel Maslowski, [1/05/22 11:07 PM]
In the cmdline, provide the rootfs location, console, and what else you may need

Daniel Maslowski, [1/05/22 11:08 PM]
If all works, build smaeul's SPL and U-Boot and put those plus that kernek on an SD card (see the docs in sunxi-linux wiki on how that works) plus the Debian rootfs.

TIm Molteno, [1/05/22 11:10 PM]
OK. Following this...? https://linux-sunxi.org/Mainline_Debian_HowTo

Daniel Maslowski, [1/05/22 11:10 PM]
The other option is to take smaeul's U-Boot and run that from memory via xfel. I'm not sure if that requires loading to a specific address though.

Not everything is upstream yet, it takes some time. You'll need to diverge from that a bit, but yes, that's the general procedure.

among dependencies not found in doc (as I start system from scratch:  swig git base-devel

Ah, someone should update that part on DRAM. It has been successfully translated to C already. :-)

this happened ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³

TIm Molteno, [1/05/22 11:18 PM]
Looking through the dts, the memory configuration seems to be included already via #include "sun20i-d1.dtsi" from #include "sun20i-d1-lichee-rv.dts".  What did you mean by add memory config to dts?

Daniel Maslowski, [1/05/22 11:19 PM]
(you'd only need it with oreboot because we don't have it yet ðŸ˜…)

Daniel Maslowski, [1/05/22 11:19 PM]
I think loading U-Boot instead will be quicker for you

Daniel Maslowski, [1/05/22 11:21 PM]
it'd look like this:
